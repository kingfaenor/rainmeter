Notes: I have never created a rainmeter skin before so there might be some things that are off or require something to be done manually

Conditions:
  1) You need a `@Resources\images\` folder
  2) In the images folder should be 12 images named from `0.png` to `11.png`

If those two conditions are met then refresh the skin and you should be good to go. If you're not send me a dm on discord
