Notes: I have never created a rainmeter skin before so there might be some things that are off or require something to be done manually

Instructions:
  Make sure you have an `images` folder in your `@Resources` folder before anything else. Add as many images to that folder as you want. The conditions to use them as a clock are 1) it must be named with the scheme of `[time-after-12].png`. So if you want an image to show at 12:00, then you would put `0.png` as the image name. Rainmeter gives me 0 for 12.
1:00 -> `100.png` and 
11:00 -> `1100.png` and 
8:30 -> `830.png` and 
4:29 -> `429.png` and 
12:01 -> `1.png`
