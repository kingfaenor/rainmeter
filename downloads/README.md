How to download:
  1) Find the latest version of the skin you want
  2) Click on it
  3) Click `View Raw` or `download`
  4) That's it, you should be done!


I'll have a better system set up later but actually publishing my side projects is where I normally get stuck so I'm hoping this will help nip that before it gets too bad haha
